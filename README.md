Module 1:
  Lesson-01: Tracing Basics
    Summary: Trace is structured record of the execution of a workflow(in this case, of an LLM Call).
    Source File: https://github.com/langchain-ai/intro-to-langsmith/blob/661952bca6c5196a8d60c5a3d64448206ca07ba4/notebooks/module_1/tracing_basics.ipynb
    Changes Made:
      App Versioning: Bumped APP_VERSION to 1.1 and linked it to runtime metadata.
      System Prompt Customization: Changed the system prompt to be teaching-focused with examples.
      Metadata: Added richer metadata (vectordb, environment, app_version, model_name, model_provider,
      temperature).
      Tags: Introduced tags (rag, retrieval, generation, llm, pipeline) for better filtering in LangSmith.
      Debug Logging: Added local debug prints of question/answer for quick inspection.

  Lesson-02: Types of Runs
    Summary: LangSmith tracks and visualizes different types of executions (called “runs”) in your language model applications. These help you debug,          monitor, and improve your system. Types Runs: LLM, Retriever, Tool, Prompt, Chain, Praiser.

    Changes Made:
      Added defensive checks in the chat model cell to ensure messages is a list of dicts with required keys.
      Avoided mutating the input list by creating a new list when adding the assistant's suggestion.
      Wrapped the chat model call in a try/except block to catch and print errors with clear messages.
      Improved robustness and error handling for Groq API calls in the notebook.

  Lesson-03: Alternative Ways to Trace
    Summary:This video teaches alternative  methods for tracing in LangSmith beyond setting environment variables. It focuses on achieving selective observability by manually passing a LangChainTracer as a callback or using the tracing_context manager to trace specific code blocks.

    Changes Made:
      Added a function to check for internet connectivity before making API calls, preventing unnecessary errors if offline.
      Provided user-friendly, visually distinct messages for different error types (no internet, connection error, HTTP error, unexpected error).
      Used emoji icons (✅, ❌, 🚫, 🌐) to make feedback more engaging and clear.
      Ensured that all exceptions are caught and explained, not just shown as raw tracebacks.
      Clearly separated success and error output, making it easier to understand what happened during execution.
