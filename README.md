Module 1:
  Lesson-01: Tracing Basics
    Summary: Trace is structured record of the execution of a workflow(in this case, of an LLM Call).
    Source File: https://github.com/langchain-ai/intro-to-langsmith/blob/661952bca6c5196a8d60c5a3d64448206ca07ba4/notebooks/module_1/tracing_basics.ipynb
    Changes Made:
      App Versioning: Bumped APP_VERSION to 1.1 and linked it to runtime metadata.
      System Prompt Customization: Changed the system prompt to be teaching-focused with examples.
      Metadata: Added richer metadata (vectordb, environment, app_version, model_name, model_provider,
      temperature).
      Tags: Introduced tags (rag, retrieval, generation, llm, pipeline) for better filtering in LangSmith.
      Debug Logging: Added local debug prints of question/answer for quick inspection.
